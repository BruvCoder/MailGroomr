  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    Mail Groomr uses access to your Gmail account solely for the 
    purpose of identifying and deleting emails that match the date range 
    you provide. 
  </p>
  <p>
    No data is collected, stored, or shared outside your own Gmail account. 
    The extension does not transmit your email contents or personal 
    information to any external servers.
  </p>
  <p>
    All actions (such as moving emails to trash) occur directly within your 
    Gmail account via the official Gmail API.
